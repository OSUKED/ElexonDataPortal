The original plot can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516307017#f0030), the following description is taken directly from the paper.\n\n> Over this period fossil fuels have become increasingly squeezed by the growth of imports, biomass, wind and solar. Coal is seen responding to seasonal changes in demand, and displaced gas over the second half of 2011. Gas generation fell steadily from an average of 17.3 GW in 2009\u201310 to just 9.3 GW in 2012\u201313. This trend reversed over the course of 2015 with gas generation rising from an average of 9.0 GW in the first quarter of 2015 to 13.8 GW in the first quarter of 2016. By May 2016 coal generation fell to an average of just 1.1 GW, and on the 10th of May instantaneous coal output fell to zero for the first in over 130 years.\n\n![](img/vis/ei_stacked_fuel.png)\n", "last_update_time": "2021-07-05 23:35"}, {"cron": "0 * * * 1", "function": "ElexonDataPortal.vis.ei.generate_moe", "kwargs": {"dt_col": "local_datetime", "dt_tz": "Europe/London", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AyrtonB/Electric-Insights/git/trees/master?recursive=1", "raw_file_prefix": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AyrtonB/Electric-Insights/master/", "reg_dates_start": "2010-01-01", "reg_dates_end": null, "reg_dates_freq": "13W", "num_fits": 15, "x_pred": null, "dt_idx": null, "dpi": 250, "use_preloaded_ei_df": true, "img_name": "moe_surface", "docs_dir": "docs", "update_time": "2021-07-05 23:35"}, "md_text": "### Marginal Price Curve Estimation\n\nThe figure shown here is reproduced from the work in [this paper](https://ayrtonb.github.io/Merit-Order-Effect/#paper) by Ayrton Bourn which investigates the merit order effect of renewables in the GB and DE power markets in terms of the price and carbon reductions - the key findings are as follows:\n\n* A LOWESS estimation of the non-linear marginal price curve for dispatchable generation shows high back-casting accuracy for Germany and Britain\n* The evolving Merit Order Effect (MOE) was estimated through a time-adaptive model, enabling long-term trends to be captured\n* In Britain the MOE has increased sharply since 2016, with a 0.67% price reduction per p.p. increase in RES penetration\n* Disaggregation of the MOE by fuel-type highlights key differences in the transition paths of Britain and Germany\n\nThis figure will be updated on a weekly basis, the last update was at: 2021-07-05 23:35\n\n<br>\n\n#### Smoothed Price Time-Series Surface\n\nThis figure shows the LOWESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) regressions for the day-ahead marginal price curve visualised as a heatmap surface, highlighting the seasonal and non-cyclical changes over time. A mask has been applied where the residual demand after RES is outside the range of 99% of the data. This view is particularly helpful for picking up long-term trends in the market, for example the higher power prices seen in 18/19 due to high gas prices.\n\n\n![](img/vis/moe_surface.png)\n", "last_update_time": "2021-07-05 23:35"}, {"cron": "0,30 * * * *", "function": "ElexonDataPortal.vis.lolp.generate_lolpdrm_imgs_text", "kwargs": {"api_key": null, "fcst_horizons": [8, 4, 2, 1], "update_time": "2021-07-09 20:35", "docs_dir": "docs"}, "md_text": "### De-Rated Margin\n\nIn each settlement period the system operator publishes the de-rated margin forecast calculated in accordance with the [Loss of Load Probability Calculation Statement](https://www.elexon.co.uk/documents/bsc-codes/lolp/loss-of-load-probability-calculation-statement/) at the following times:\n\n* At 1200 hours on each calendar day for all Settlement Periods for which Gate Closure has not yet passed and which occur within the current Operational Day or the following Operational Day; and\n* At eight, four, two and one hour(s) prior to the beginning of the Settlement Period to which the De-Rated Margin Forecast relates.\n\nThese figures will be updated on an hourly basis, the last update was at: 2021-07-09 20:35\n\n<br>\n\n#### Forecasts\n\nThe following heatmap shows the evolving de-rated margin forecast across the different forecast horizons.\n\n![](img/vis/drm_fcst_htmp.png)\n\n<br>\n\n#### Forecast Deltas\n\nThe following heatmap shows how the more recent de-rated margin forecasts deviate from the 8 hours ahead forecast.\n\n![](img/vis/drm_fcst_delta_htmp.png)\n", "last_update_time": "2021-07-09 20:35"}, {"cron": "0,30 * * * *", "function": "ElexonDataPortal.vis.map.generate_map", "kwargs": {"data_dir": "data/PN", "api_key": null, "update_time": "2021-07-09 20:35", "powerdict_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSUKED/Power-Station-Dictionary/main/data/output/power_stations.csv", "js_template_fp": "templates/map.js", "js_docs_fp": "docs/js/map.js", "md_template_fp": "templates/map.md", "plants_geojson_fp": "data/power_plants.json", "plants_geojson_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSUKED/ElexonDataPortal/master/data/power_plants.json", "routes_geojson_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSUKED/ElexonDataPortal/master/data/network_routes.json"}, "md_text": "### Power Output Map\n\nLast Updated: 2021-07-09 20:35\n\nThis map shows the power output of individual plants connected to the transmission grid as stated in their most recent Physical Notifications.
